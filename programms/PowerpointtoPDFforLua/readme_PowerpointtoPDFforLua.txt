This repository has a Lua script to convert a powerpoint file to PDF with Luacom

The conversion is done only if the corresponding PDF does not exist or if the date of the securisation is older than the date of the powerpoint file.

1. PowerpointtoPDFforLua_Windows.lua

This script is only for Windows because there the luacom-Library of the IUP-Lua framework is available.
