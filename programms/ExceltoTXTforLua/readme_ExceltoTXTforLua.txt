This repository has a Lua script to convert an excel file to TXT with Luacom

The conversion is done only if the corresponding TXT does not exist or if the date of the securisation is older than the date of the excel file.

1. ExceltoTXTforLua_Windows.lua

This script is only for Windows because there the luacom-Library of the IUP-Lua framework is available.

2. Excel_Tree.xlsm

This excel file contains a vba tree.

3. ExcelColumnFormattoTXTandLuaTree.lua

This script exports an Excel file with the data in independent columns in textfile csv with tabulators and write the content in a tree.
