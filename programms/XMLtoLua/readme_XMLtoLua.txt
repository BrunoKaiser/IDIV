In this directory there are conversion scripts for taking a XML file to write the corresponding Lua script that can be used in a DocumentationTree

1. example_XML.txt

This is an example file for XML to be converted to a Lua table with a conversion script. The file extension is here not .xml but .txt because it shows that it is a simple text file treatment. These Lua scripts do not need a XML parser, but treat the information in the file to build a new Lua script. The use of a file with extension .xml is the same. Only the file name must be adapted.

2. XMLtoLua_Linux.lua

Version for Linux for instance with the Tree.jar-GUI.

3.1 XMLtoLua_Windows.lua 

Version fo Windows for instance with the Tree.jar-GUI.

3.2 XMLtoLua_Windows_ANSI_german.lua

This version is written for the use with the IUP-Lua-GUI ansicht_documentation_tree.lua.

A special case to be adapted for different languages. Here there is the german version.
